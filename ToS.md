# pmmpStats - Term of Services
By using our service you agree to abide by the Terms of Service

## 1. No spam to our API
Our API is designed to hold heavy traffic but not for a single plugin, so it is prohibited to make more than one request every two minutes to our endpoint.<br>
It is also not useful since statistics are processed every half hour

## 2. Sending fake data is prohibited
We categorically prohibit sending bogus/modified data to ensure better advertising, such as sending a different player number than the real one.<br>
Our system performs daily checks on the shared data to make sure everything is correct and if any abnormality is found we will ban the plugin from the service.

## 3. Reproduction of data
We allow the reproduction of data provided by our services under these conditions:
- In the case of images of charts, it is necessary to add a link that, upon clicking on the image leads to our service.
- Provide text credits that, via a link where possible lead back to our service

## 4. Disabling the service
We reserve the right to disable this service for any plugin that does not follow our guidelines or is not suitable for the platform without prior notice and warning.<br>
However, we are not required to provide reasons for the removal of the service.

## 5. Our rights
We reserve the right to change the service, these terms, and any service related to the **pmmpStats** brand without prior notice and notice.<br>
